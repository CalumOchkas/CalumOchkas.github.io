New Zealand seems to be lagging behind a bit when it comes to certified smarthome devices that are well known and trusted by electricians around the country.

PDL however, is a well-known and trusted manufacturer in New Zealand, and their new Iconic range includes some Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) switches that work with their propietary apps for both iOS and Android.  This works great, but what about if we want to integrate this with our existing home automation systems like HomeAssistant, Amazon Alexa or Google Home?

I'm going to spend some tim eattempting to get this going, and at the same time attempt to document it here for others to use in the future.

Repository to come, watch closely!
